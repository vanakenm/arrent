    entries:
      - Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a `dc:16` Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

        The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:

        - **Fire Breath.** The dragon exhales fire in an 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a `dc:18` Dexterity saving throw, taking `dmg:13d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
        - **Sleep Breath.** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a `dc:CON` Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
